# Web Vulnerability Scanner

A comprehensive web vulnerability scanner that detects common security issues including XSS, SQL Injection, CSRF, Security Headers, and other OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.

## Features

- **XSS Detection**: Identifies potential Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities
- **SQL Injection Detection**: Tests for SQL injection vulnerabilities
- **CSRF Protection Check**: Verifies CSRF token implementation
- **Security Headers Analysis**: Checks for missing security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- **Outdated Library Detection**: Identifies known vulnerabilities in common libraries
- **SSL/TLS Analysis**: Checks certificate validity and protocols
- **Cookie Security Analysis**: Examines cookie flags and attributes
- **Report Generation**: Generates detailed HTML reports with findings and remediation

## Quick Start (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Install Python (if not already installed)
```powershell
winget install Python.Python.3.11
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the project directory
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\[YourUsername]\source\repos\Cybersecurity project\Web-Vulnerability-Scanner"
```

### Step 3: Install dependencies
```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Run a scan
```powershell
python scanner.py -u https://example.com -o report.html -v
```

### Step 5: View the report
Open `report.html` in your web browser to see detailed vulnerability findings.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or with the full Python path on Windows:
```powershell
&"C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\python.exe" -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Basic Scan
```bash
python scanner.py -u https://example.com
```

### Full Scan with Report
```bash
python scanner.py -u https://example.com -o report.html -v
```

### Scan Multiple URLs
```bash
python scanner.py -u https://example.com,https://example2.com -o report.html
```

## Arguments

- `-u, --url`: Target URL(s) to scan (required)
- `-o, --output`: Output report filename (default: vulnerability_report.html)
- `-v, --verbose`: Enable verbose output
- `-t, --timeout`: Request timeout in seconds (default: 10)
- `-p, --payloads`: Custom payloads file
- `--headers`: Custom headers JSON file

## Vulnerability Categories

### Critical
- SQL Injection
- Remote Code Execution
- Authentication Bypass

### High
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- CSRF without token
- Missing Security Headers
- Insecure SSL/TLS

### Medium
- Outdated JavaScript libraries
- Information Disclosure
- Weak Cookie Configuration

### Low
- Missing HTTP Security Headers
- Verbose Error Messages

## Report

The scanner generates a detailed HTML report including:
- Vulnerability summary
- Detailed findings with severity levels
- Affected URLs and parameters
- Remediation recommendations
- Technical details and references

## Working Example

Here's an example of running the scanner on example.com:

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Mohamed\source\repos\Cybersecurity project\Web-Vulnerability-Scanner> python scanner.py -u https://example.com -o test_report.html -v

[INFO] Starting scan on https://example.com
[INFO] Status code: 200
[INFO] Checking security headers...
[INFO] Found: Missing X-Frame-Options
[INFO] Found: Missing X-Content-Type-Options
[INFO] Checking SSL/TLS configuration...
[INFO] Checking cookie security...
[INFO] Generating report: test_report.html
[INFO] Report saved to test_report.html

============================================================
Scan complete!
Total vulnerabilities found: 6
  MEDIUM: 6
Report saved to: test_report.html
============================================================
```

The `test_report.html` file will be created with a detailed interactive report showing all vulnerabilities with severity levels and remediation steps.

## Troubleshooting

### Python not found
Make sure Python is installed and added to PATH:
```powershell
python --version
```

### SSL Certificate Error
Some sites may have certificate issues. The scanner handles this gracefully by continuing with other checks.

### Permission Denied
Run PowerShell as Administrator if you get permission errors.

### Timeout Error
Increase timeout with the `-t` flag:
```powershell
python scanner.py -u https://example.com -t 30
```
